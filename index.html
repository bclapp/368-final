			<p class="rc">I like to go backpacking in the mountains when I can. 
			This last summer I was able to work in Montana and got to see some pretty cool views while I was there. 

			I'am currently on my second year here at Eastern but am a transfer student. I went to school in Oregon for two years before coming here. I m currently going to school for Computer Information Systems and hope to graduate by the end of next winter quarter in 2015..

			<h2 class="lc" id="pheading">General Interest</h2>
			<div class="lc">
			<p> I probably spend most of my time sitting at home taking care of my dogs and crusing the internet when I am not studying. 

				I currently live in the valley so its been pretty hard to stay included with activities in Chenney. I actually hope to move closer to the school next quarter.
			</p><p>I am really into computers. I built one not to long ago. I honestly think anyone can build a computer. All it took was a little research and few tutorials and it was finished. </p>

			<h2 class="rc" id="pheading">Cool Sites That I Like</h2>
			<div class="rc">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/all/">Reddit.com</a><p>Reddit! The "Front page of the Internet." Lots of links to many things. I probably spend most of my online time here.</p></li>
				
				<li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia!</a><p>I like to some times just hit the random botton and learn something new in my spare time.</p></li>
				
				<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php">Facebook!
